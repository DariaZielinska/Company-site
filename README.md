## What is missing? 

- I have a lot to learn about BEM convention. I still use tags in stylesheet, which I know is a bad habit and I try to work on it. 
- I also did not import the Myriad Pro font, which I could not find free access to. 
- In the first version, the form was validated while user inputs data, I used the "keyup" event for this, but I encountered problems related to the final validation and inputs' red borders, which is why I changed to the current version.

- [?] I read in the documentation about the commit message convention and I honestly wonder if I did it correctly.
- [?] Optimizing image loading is a topic that I do not quite understand. One of the pictures (phone from the main section) is displayed in a different resolution depending on the window width, but the rest displayed well in low resolution even on the big screen, that's why I did not change them. 

## Summary:

I've learned a lot of new things and I'm glad that I could have the opportunity to do this task. Most importantly, I had the opportunity to cut layout using Zeplin, which I had only read about before. I learned how to use the gradient for text and borders (really, i have never done this before), I found out that pseudo-elements do not work on img and that you can't validate your form when you use word "sumbit" in event (it took me some time before I noticed :) ).

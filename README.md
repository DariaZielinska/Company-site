# Company Site

## About? 
Company Site is another project that create opportunity to learn, practise and try things that I've never done before. I learned how to use the gradient for text and borders (really, first time), I found out that pseudo-elements do not work on img and that you can't validate your form when you use word "sumbit" in event (it took me some time before I noticed :) ). It was first try with BEM methodology (which I did not use in 100%, I still use tags in stylesheet, what I know is a bad habit and I try to work on it). Also I was trying to use commits in more properly way - writing it based od commit message convention.
